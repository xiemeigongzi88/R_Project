# Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy
    Do women live longer than men? How long? Does it happen everywhere? Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere? Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest? 

## Target:
    In this project, you will answer all these questions by manipulating and visualizing United Nations life expectancy data using ggplot2.

    Dataset: http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=GenderStat&f=inID:37&c=1,2,3,4,5,6&s=crEngName:asc,sgvEngName:asc,timeEngName:desc&v=1. It covers four periods: 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005.

## Steps：
	Data preprocessing 
	Visualizing life expectancy of men vs. women 
	Visualizing life expectancy by gender evolved 
	
## Conclusion: 
I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Visualizing Inequalities in Life Expectancy”, https://www.datacamp.com/projects/166

# Data Analysis of IMDB and Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning with R:
  A lot of factors such as good directors, experienced actors are considerable for creating good movies. However, famous directors and actors can always bring an expected box-office income but cannot guarantee a highly rated IMDB score.
Based on the massive movie information, it would be interesting to understand what are the important factors that make a movie more successful than others.

  Dataset: https://data.world/data-society/imdb-5000-movie-dataset
  
## Target: 
  In this project, we take IMDB scores as response variable and focus on operating predictions by analyzing the rest of variables in the IMDB 5000 movie data. The results can help film companies to understand the secret of generating a commercial success movie.

## Steps:
  Data Exploration:  data cleaning, splitting genres, 
  Data Visualization: Histogram of Movie Released, Top 20 movies based on its Profit, Top 20 movies based on its Return on Investment, Top 20 directors with highest average IMDB score, Commercial Success v.s. Critical Acclaim.
  Data Preprocessing for machine learning 

## Conclusion: 
  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset”, http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/342210_7c8d57cfdd784cf58dc077d3eb7a2ca3.html

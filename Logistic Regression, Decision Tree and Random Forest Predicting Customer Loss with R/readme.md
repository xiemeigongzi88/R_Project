# Using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest to Predict Customer Loss with R
  One industry in which churn rates are particularly useful is the telecommunications industry, because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location. We will introduce Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict customer churn using telecom dataset.

## Steps:
	Data Preprocessing 
  Exploratory data analysis and feature selection
  Logistic Regression
  Decision Tree
  Random Forest

## Conclusion 
  Throughout the analysis, I have learned several important things:
  Features such as tenure_group, Contract, PaperlessBilling, MonthlyCharges and InternetService appear to play a role in customer churn.
  There does not seem to be a relationship between gender and churn.
  Customers in a month-to-month contract, with PaperlessBilling and are within 12 months tenure, are more likely to churn; On the other hand, customers with one or two year contract, with longer than 12 months tenure, that are not using PaperlessBilling, are less likely to churn.

  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Predict Customer Churn with R”, https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-customer-churn-with-r-9e62357d47b4

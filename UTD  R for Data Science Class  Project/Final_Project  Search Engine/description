# Building a simple search engine in R powered by the cosine similarity

##  How Cosine Similarity works:
Cosine Similarity algorithm parses a document into a vector where each entry is the number of occurrence of a word in this document, then to compare the similarity of two documents we just need to calculate the cosine of the two vectors.

## Steps
### 1, Data preperation
### 2, Building a search function
### 3, Testing

The result can be seen in report document.

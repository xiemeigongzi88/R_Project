1. You have to identify a text classification problem and dataset
from UCI text datasets
You are responsible for splitting the data into two parts: train and
test
2. You have to preprocess the data. It involves removing stop
words, converting words to vectors, choosing how many words
you would like to use and finally make the data suitable for
being used as an input layer.
Hint: It’s totally upto you how you do this. A good resource is the
tm package in R

3. Create a deep network using Keras package. It’s upto you to
design this. Remember to design the output layer based on the
data features.
4. You need to run your code on Google Cloud with GPU
enabled. We had given you an introduction in class. You
will need to figure out the details - such as how to
transfer to cloud and refer to them in your code

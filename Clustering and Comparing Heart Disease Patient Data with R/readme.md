# Using Kmeans to cluster heart disease patient data 
  Doctors frequently study former cases to learn how to do best treatment. A patient who has a similar health history or symptoms to a previous patient could benefit from undergoing the same treatment. This project investigates whether doctors might be able to group together patients to target treatments using common unsupervised learning K-means algorithm.

## Steps:
  Targeting treatment for heart disease patients 
  Grouping patients by k-means twice
  Comparing patient clusters 
  Hierarchical clustering

## Conclusion: 
  Trying out multiple clustering algorithms, it is necessary to determine if we think any of them will work for clustering our patients. For the k-means algorithm, it is imperative that similar clusters are produced for each iteration of the algorithm. We want to make sure that the algorithm is clustering signal as opposed to noise.

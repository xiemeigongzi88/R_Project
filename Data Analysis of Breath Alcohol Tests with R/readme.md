# Data Analysis of Breath Alcohol Test with R 
 
  Using data collected from the State of Iowa, and the data wrangling and visualization skills will be learned.

## Target: 
  Trying to get familiar with Tidyverse, dplyr and ggplot2 
  Tools: Tidyverse, dplyr and ggplot2 

## Steps: 
  Data preprocessing of breath alcohol test in Iowa, USA
  Nothing Good Happens after 2am
  Breathalyzer tests by month
  Finding a pattern of breathalyzer tests 
  Visualizing the timelines 

## Conclusion: 

  I just got the fun from the hidden insights of data. And this project was inspired by the project “Who Is Drunk and When in Ames, Iowa?”, https://www.datacamp.com/projects/208
